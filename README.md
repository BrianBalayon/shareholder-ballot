# shareholder-balloti

This is the CSE 426 project 1 by Brian Balayon and Hans Bas.

## Abstract

Shareholders to a company have the right to vote in elections that deal with matters that directly
affect their stock ownership. The nature of these voting rights and the issues shareholders are
entitled to vote on can vary from one company to another. Some companies grant shareholders
one vote per share (more shares you own, the more votes), other companies grant
shareholders only one vote, regardless of the number of shares owned. These voting rights
allow shareholders to influence the company’s corporate direction. Our project idea essentially
takes this idea and breaks it down into two actors: company and shareholders. The company is
the ultimate deciding factor of the weight of the shareholders’ votes and the issues they can
vote upon, while the shareholders can allocate their votes.
